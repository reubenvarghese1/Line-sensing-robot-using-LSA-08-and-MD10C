# Line-sensing-robot-using-LSA-08-and-MD10C
Here is my Arduino code for a line sensing bot using 4 motor drivers(MD-10C).Pins used for the motor drivers can be redefined in the code and the pins used for the lsa-08 are given in the code.This has auto line aligning integrated in it and hence it is not necessary that you place your robot straight onto the line to be followed.You may keep it as you want as long as the line is below the lsa(to be updated).

LOL can't touch this!
